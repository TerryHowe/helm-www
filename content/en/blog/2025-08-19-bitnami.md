# Bitnami Catalog Changes Coming August 28, 2025

Bitnami is restructuring its container images and Helm charts:

* Public images: Most Debian-based images will move to a Legacy repo (unsupported). Only a small set of hardened, latest-tagged images will remain free under bitnamisecure.
* Production use: To get versioned, regularly updated images, organizations must subscribe to Bitnami Secure Images—a paid tier with hardened OS, security rebuilds, compliance artifacts, and enterprise support.
* Helm charts: Source code stays open-source on GitHub, but OCI charts may require overriding image references.

## Timeline

* Now → Aug 28, 2025: Start testing with bitnamisecure images.
* After Aug 28: Legacy repo is frozen; only limited secure images remain public.

Bottom line: Free access shrinks to a handful of latest images. For stability and production use, migration to Bitnami Secure Images—or alternatives—will be necessary.
