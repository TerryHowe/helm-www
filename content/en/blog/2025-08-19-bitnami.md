# Bitnami Catalog Changes (August 28, 2025)

Bitnami is restructuring its container images and Helm charts. The following details the changes and their impacts to Helm users:

* Public images: Most Debian-based images will move to a Legacy repo (unsupported). Only a small set of hardened, latest-tagged images will remain free under [bitnamisecure Docker organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/bitnamisecure).
* Production use: To get versioned, regularly updated images, organizations must subscribe to Bitnami Secure Images—a paid tier with hardened OS, security rebuilds, compliance artifacts, and enterprise support.
* Helm charts: Source code remains open-source on GitHub. However, OCI charts may require overriding image references.

## Timeline

* Now → Aug 28, 2025: Assess the announced changes and their impact to your workflows. Begin testing with updated content sources
* After Aug 28: Legacy repository is frozen; only limited, secure images remain public.

Bottom line: Free access to Bitnami content shrinks to a handful set of latest images. For stability and production use, migration to Bitnami Secure Images—or alternatives—will be necessary.

For more information, see the [Bitnami announcement](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/35164) related to these changes and the steps that you can take.
