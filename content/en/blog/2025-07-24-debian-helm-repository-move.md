If you are installing helm with Apt, be aware that the Debian/Ubuntu Helm Apt repository is moving.
Previously the repository was hosted at [old repository](https://helm.baltorepo.com/stable/debian/) and
now it will be hosted at [new repository](https://helm.baltorepo.com/stable/debian/).
Be sure to update and references to the helm repository before the old repository is taken down.
